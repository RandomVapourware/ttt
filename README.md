A simple tic-tac-toe game for Turbo C on DOS.
May Require EGAVGA.BGI from Turbo C to be placed in directory.
May not work on real hardware; I used emulator 86Box.
Screen resolution is hard coded, sorry.

A retroprogramming exercise for fun; released to public domain or as close to that as possible.
